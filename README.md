# Alien Invasion

## Motivation:
I maked this game "Alien Invasion" because I learned the python 
language. I walked through the python language essentials + pygame and 
the sublime text editor. I show also my skills because I added to this 
programm my own code.

## Rights:
This game was made on the basis of the book "Python Crash Course - 
A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming" by Eric Matthes. 
The code is not the same like in the book. The autor of the book give 
me the right, I quote, "to share the code you wrote for the exercises 
in the book to show people what you have learned", but he give me one 
stipulation, I quote, "as long as you're not trying to create 
a learning resource based largely on the material from this book". 
So please don't create a learning resource from this material.

## Requirements: 
python 3.7 - rest in filr: "requirements.txt".

## Remarks:
I maked this game so that the master branch had always 
the functioning code. To run the game you must run the file
"alien_invasion.py".

## Game Summary:
In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at the 
bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and 
left using the arrow keys or keys a and d and shoot bullets using 
the spacebar or the left mouse button. When the game begins, a fleet of 
the aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. 
The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all 
the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous 
fleet. If any alien hits the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of 
the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, 
the game ends.

## Thanks:
I want to thank my niece Dominika (she is 10 years old) for the making 
of the images of the spaceships of the alien and the spaceship of 
the gamer especially for me and for this game.

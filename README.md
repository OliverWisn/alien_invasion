# Projectno1
I make this game "Alien Invasion" because I learn the python language. 
I would like to walk through the python language essentials with the
standard library + pygame and the sublime text editor. I would like 
to show my skills because I will add to this programm my own code in 
the future. This game is made on the basis of the book "Python Crash 
Course - A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming" by 
Eric Matthes. The autor of the book give me the right, I quote, "to 
share the code you wrote for the exercises in the book to show people 
what you have learned", but he give me one stipulation, I quote, "as 
long as you're not trying to create a learning resource based largely 
on the material from this book. So please don't create a learning 
resource from this material.
Requirements: python 3.7 - rest in requirements.txt .

# Alien Invasion

## Motivation:
I make this game "Alien Invasion" because I learn the python 
language. I would like to walk through the python language essentials 
with the standard library + pygame and the sublime text editor. I would 
like to show my skills because I will add to this programm my own code 
in the future. 

## Rights:
This game is made on the basis of the book "Python Crash Course - 
A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming" by Eric Matthes. 
The autor of the book give me the right, I quote, "to share the code 
you wrote for the exercises in the book to show people what you have 
learned", but he give me one stipulation, I quote, "as long as you're 
not trying to create a learning resource based largely on the material 
from this book". So please don't create a learning resource from this 
material.

## Requirements: 
python 3.7 - rest in requirements.txt .

## Remarks:
I make this game so that the master branch has always 
the functioning code. To run the game you must run the file
"alien_invasion.py".

## Game Summary:
In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at the 
bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and 
left using the arrow keys or keys a and d and shoot bullets using 
the spacebar or the left mouse button. When the game begins, a fleet of 
the aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. 
The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all 
the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous 
fleet. If any alien hits the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of 
the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, 
the game ends.

## Thanks:

I would like to thank to my niece Dominika (she is 10 years old) for 
the making of the images of the spaceships of the alien and 
the spaceship of the gamer especially for me and for this game.
